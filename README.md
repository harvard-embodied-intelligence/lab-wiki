## Storage Locations

Temporary Scratch Storage (Will get deleted). We have 50TB
of storage here

```
/n/netscratch/ydu_lab/
```

Larger Persistent Memory Storage (4TB of storage)

```
/n/holylabs/LABS/ydu_lab
```

Larger Persistent Memory Storage (30TB of storage)

## Compute Resources

There are several allocation GPU partitions (kempner, kempner_h100, kempner_requeue, gpu_requeue). 

More details can be found [here](https://handbook.eng.kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/intro.html)

- The kempner_h100 partition allows high priority allocations of H100s
- The kempner partition allow allocations of A100s
- The kempner_requeue partition allows for lower priority allocation of both H100s and A100s. This is the recommended partition to you
- The gpu_requeue partition allows for lower priority allocations of SEAS GPUs. This partition has less resources.

For larger cluster allocations
